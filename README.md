# structure_factor:

Approximate the structure facture of a point pattern, (a stationary point process) of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and test the effective hyperuniformity and the class of hyperuniformity of the considered point pattern.

## Introduction:
 In condensed matter physics, it has been observed for some particle systems that, the variance of the number of points in a large window is lower than expected, a phenomenon called hyperuniformity.
